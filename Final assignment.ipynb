    "Overview\n",
    "Python has powerful tools that allow us to almost do anything with datasets such as organizing the data, aggregating, cleaning, analyzing, visualizing and more! For this assignment, you will be given a dataset and use them to ask and answer questions. Be sure to comment thoroughly so that it is clear that you understand what every line of the code is intended to accomplish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset\n",
    "You will work with a dataset that contains information on airline passengers. The dataset includes information on passengers' gender, customer type, age, type of travel, travel class, flight distance; results of a satisfaction survey given to these passengers; departure and arrival delays in minutes; and overall passenger satisfaction. The results of the satisfaction survey are on a scale of 1 to 5, where 5 is most satisfied and 1 is least satisfied. Detailed information about the variables in the datasets are given below.\n",

    "Dataset:\n",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZUCourses/SIA-Public/main/airline_passengers.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables:\n",
    "- Gender: Gender of the passengers (Female, male)\n",
    "- Customer type: The customer type (Loyal customer, disloyal customer)\n",
    "- Age: The actual age of the passengers\n",
    "- Type of travel: Purpose of the flight of the passengers (Personal travel, Business travel)\n",
    "- Class: Travel class in the plane (Business, Eco, Eco plus)\n",
    "- Flight distance: The flight distance of this journey\n",
    "- Departure delay in minutes\n",
    "- Arrival delay in minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "Satisfaction survey variables:\n",
    "- Inflight wifi service: Satisfaction level with inflight wifi\n",
    "- Departure/Arrival time convenient: Satisfaction level with the departure and arrival times\n",
    "- Food and drink: Satisfaction level with food and drink\n",
    "- Seat comfort: Satisfaction level with seats\n",
    "- Inflight entertainment: Satisfaction level with inflight entertainment\n",
    "- Inflight service: Satisfaction level with inflight service\n",
    "- Cleanliness: Satisfaction level with cleanliness\n",
    "- satisfaction: overall flight satisfaction (classified as neutral_or_dissatisfied and satisfied)\n",
